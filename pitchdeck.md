* **Key Features Demonstrated:**
  * **Architect Agent:** Makes initial high-level technical decision (Python, standard library).
  * **Planner Agent:** Refines user request (with Human-in-the-Loop for ambiguity resolution).
  * **Developer Agent:** Generates Python code based on plan and RAG-retrieved coding standards.
  * **QA Agent:** Uses LLM-driven tool selection (`code_tester_tool`) for functional testing (MCP concept).
  * **Validation Agent:** Checks code for compliance and basic security using RAG-retrieved rules.
  * **Critique Agent:** Provides targeted feedback on failures (functional or validation).
  * **Iterative Refinement:** LangGraph orchestrates the "Code -> Test/Validate -> Critique -> Refine" loop.
  * **Artifact Packaging & Handoff:** Generates code files and README.
  * **Configurable & Observable:** Hybrid LLM strategy, environment-based config, detailed logging.
