# What's Still Missing for the Full Design (Summary)

1. **True Multi-Language/Framework Capability** (Scala Spark, Airflow DAGs, etc., with corresponding developer agents and tools).
2. **Sophisticated Tool Repository & Execution (MCP/Taskweaver)** with actual external tool calls and sandboxing.
3. **Advanced Project Management** (complex task breakdown, parallelism).
4. **Scalable Infrastructure Components** (production Vector DB, K8s deployment, advanced monitoring).
5. **Deeper Security Agent Integration** (SAST tools).
6. **VCS Integration** (Git).
7. **More Complex SDLC Scenarios** (multi-component pipelines, not just single functions).
8. **Refined Error Handling & Resilience** for each agent and the overall graph.
9. **More Granular 12-Factor Adherence** (e.g., explicit backing services, build/run/release separation if scaling up).
10. **Cost Optimization Strategies** beyond just model selection (e.g., caching, request batching).
11. **Sophisticated User Interface** (instead of console HITL).
